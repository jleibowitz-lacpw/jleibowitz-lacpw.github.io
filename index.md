# Welcome

Hi. I'm Jon. Find my github profile [here](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw)

I'm a member of [Los Angeles County Public Works](https://pw.lacounty.gov), on the Web Administration team. I'm a mid-career systems person in the middle of reinvention. Currently I'm a Computer Information Systems student at [Pasadena City College](https://pasadena.edu), transferring to [Cal State LA](https://www.calstatela.edu) in 2026.

## What I've done

I've worked in data centers, supported animation pipelines ([DreamWorks Animation](https://www.dreamworks.com/), Glendale), cloud support ([DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)), and a short stint with [LA County ISD](https://isd.lacounty.gov/) building [CI/CD pipelines in Groovy](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) for [OpenShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift).

## What is this site

This is a demonstration of GitHub Pages as a product, a static hosting service, as well as an exploration of [a digital garden](https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/digital_garden/) or public area to showcase and explore ideas. 

## Office Hours {#office-hours}

Book an [Office Hours time slot](https://cal.com/jleibowitz-lacpw) for unofficial [DevRel](https://jleibowitz-lacpw.github.io/presentations/ideas/devrel) presentations and discussion sessions. [Topics will be diverse and enlightening](https://jleibowitz-lacpw.github.io/presentations/), including:
- [GitHub Pages + Markdown](https://jleibowitz-lacpw.github.io/presentations/web/github-pages)
- Security culture
- Whatever comes up
