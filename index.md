# Welcome

Hi. I'm Jon. Find my github profile [here](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw)

I'm a member of [Los Angeles County Public Works](https://pw.lacounty.gov), on the Web Administration team. I'm a mid-career systems person in the middle of reinvention. Currently I'm a Computer Information Systems student at [Pasadena City College](https://pasadena.edu), transferring to [Cal State LA](https://www.calstatela.edu) in Spring 2026.

## What I've done

I've worked in data centers, supported animation pipelines (DreamWorks Animation, Glendale), cloud support (DigitalOcean), and a short stint with LA County ISD building CI/CD pipelines in Groovy for OpenShift.

## Office Hours

[Topics will be diverse and enlightening](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw/marp-presentations), including:
