# Welcome

Hi. I'm Jon. Find my github profile [here](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw)

I'm a member of [Los Angeles County Public Works](https://pw.lacounty.gov), on the Web Administration team. I'm a mid-career systems person in the middle of reinvention. Currently I'm a Computer Information Systems student at [Pasadena City College](https://pasadena.edu), transferring to [Cal State LA](https://www.calstatela.edu) in 2026.

## What I've done

I've worked in data centers, supported animation pipelines ([DreamWorks Animation](https://www.dreamworks.com/), Glendale), cloud support ([DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)), and a short stint with [LA County ISD](https://isd.lacounty.gov/) building [CI/CD pipelines in Groovy](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) for [OpenShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift).

## Office Hours

Book an [Office Hours time slot](https://cal.com/jleibowitz-lacpw) for unofficial [DevRel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jleibowitz-lacpw/marp-presentations/refs/heads/main/ideas/devrel.md) presentations and discussion sessions. [Topics will be diverse and enlightening](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw/marp-presentations), including:
- [GitHub Pages + Markdown](https://github.com/jleibowitz-lacpw/marp-presentations/blob/main/web/github-pages.md)
